# Collaborative Beatbox

MIDI sequencer application that uses a Swing GUI instance to collect the state of 16 rows of 16 JCheckBox objects, each representing an instrument to be played on a specific beat through the use of MIDI events. JCheckBox state is kept in an array, which is processed and turned into MidiEvent objects upon pressing 'Start', according to the instrument selected. The MidiEvents are thus added to a track which are then added to a sequence, ultimately played by a sequencer. The program will then loop and continue playing all instruments on their respective beat until user presses 'Stop'. The tempo of the current beat can also be sped up and down with the 'Tempo Up' and 'Tempo Down' features.

Beat patterns can be serialized as an object to a local file and deserialized using the 'Save' and 'Load' features, allowing users to send beats amongst each other. A multithreaded chat server is also implemented to allow for collaborative music creation through the sharing of ideas. The server opens a ServerSocket connection and listens on a port for any connecting clients, generating an object from a handler class with each acting on its own thread. Each thread when executed will open two character streams to store the the username of the connecting client and their messages in separate hash sets, broadcasting both to all clients.

Inspired by BeatBoxFinal.java class from the book 'Head First Java' with many added attributes such as the aforementioned serialization buttons and self-implemented chat client/server: [Head First Java, Second Edition](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjava/)
